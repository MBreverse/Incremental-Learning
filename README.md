# Incremental-Learning
There is implementation of incremental learning in ways of survy approachs, including：
1. Learning without forgetting(Distillation) Y. Wu et al., “Large scale incremental learning,” Proc. IEEE Conf. on Comput. Vision 
and Pattern Recognit., 2019, pp. 374-382.
2. Learning for large scale (Bias and correction, BiC)
3. End-to-End incremental learning (EEIL)
4. Purposed Method(using pseudo examplar produced by CVAE)
